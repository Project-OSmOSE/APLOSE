                        Hello, we are OSmOSE ; a consortium of data scientists and ocean researchers developing open
                        source tools
                        and services for underwater passive acoustics. It all started in Brest (French Brittany) in
                        2018, with the
                        diagnosis that our community was lacking a common ground to compare our methods and highlight
                        our results.
                        To address this situation, our data processing tools aim to standardize and provide easy access
                        to various
                        routine tasks, from manual annotation to related AI workflows for detection and classification
                        of sounds
                        events. This is the cornerstone of most underwater passive acoustic applications.
