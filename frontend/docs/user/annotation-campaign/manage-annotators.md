You can also add annotators by group.

::: details Create an annotator group
Access APLOSEs administration part with the "Admin" link

Look for “Annotator group” in the “APLOSE” block and click on “Add”

![](/campaign-creator/annotator-group/nav.png)

You can fill in the form with the name of your group, and add the users you want in.

![](/campaign-creator/annotator-group/form.png)

When your form is filled you can save it.

::: warning

For now the group is just a helper to add many annotators at once, but the linked isn't kept between the group and the campaign. If you later add annotator to the group, they won't be added to the campaign!
