A phase characterises the work carried out on a campaign. There are two types of phase:

- "Annotation": This type of phase is used to make an initial annotation of the campaign, based on empty spectrograms.
  This type of phase can also be used to import external annotations, for example from automatic detectors.
- "Verification": Verification phases are used to validate/invalidate annotations made in the “Annotation” phase. If a
  user is assigned to both phases, he will not be able to validate his own annotations.

The two phases can take place simultaneously.
