It defines the assignment of a label in a specific segment. The annotation can be represented as a box within the
segment (i.e. strong detection). It is drawn by the user and must frame the sound of interest. Another possible
representation is the presence of a sound of interest in the whole segment (i.e. weak detection). In APLOSE, the
annotator can also leave a comment and/or express its confidence on any annotation.
